## Overview

Short research article about the distribution of the historical Volatility Risk Premium in option contracts of the S&P500 index measured by implied volatility (VIX) and subsequent realized historical vol. It involved assessing the normality of the VRP, its closeness to a skewed and standard t-distribution and the better fit of a generalized normal distribution to the data.
